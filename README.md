 A new version of box-ios-sdk.

 Fixed:
 - SHA_DIGEST_LENGTH Problem with iOS 12
 
 ## HOW TO USE
 
In the Podfile please add this line at the bottom where you want to use box-ios-sdk. It basically contains fully source code as the original version. Just update a few lines code to be compatible with Xcode 12.

```
pod 'box-ios-sdk-pod', :git => 'https://github.com/dlpigpen/box-ios-sdk-pod.git'
```

## Thank You
Any question, please add an issue
